I'm Owen, here are some random things I either discover, think about, just create, or frantically overthink.
There is no coherent overall structure governing the topics I might cover - so let us just see what comes out of it and what my next hyperfocus will be.

My background is mainly Aerospace Engineering, Machine Learning, and Environmental Engineering.  
Recently, I have been paying more attention to Ecology in general.

All views are my own and can change with time (especially after 2am).

Oh yeah, and I have ADHD and dyslexia - probably will explain a lot of my tangents, strong opinions about accessibility, and posts that occasionally get edited/fixed a week (or month) later.
